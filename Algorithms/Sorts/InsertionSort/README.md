# Insertion Sort
Much less efficient compared to other sorting algorithms.

Time Complexity - `O(n^2)`

It is a very simple algorithm. 

The current element is indexed as `j`. There is an outer loop to go through all the elements.

In each iteration, we will compare if the current element is lesser than previous element, if found to be true, we swap. This is accomplished through while loop and decrementing the counter.

Then, we return the result.
