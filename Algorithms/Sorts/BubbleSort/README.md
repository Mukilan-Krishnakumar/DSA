# Bubble Sort
Easiest sorting algorithm ever. It is slower than other sorting algorithms.

We always start from the beginning(second element), we go through every subsequent element and check if the previous element is greater than the current element, if found to be greater, it will be swapped.

Pseudocode:
1. Set swapping to be True
2. while swapping
3. Set swapping to be False (so, we can quit this thing)
4. Start from the second element and check if previous element is greater, if greater swap, set swapping to be True
5. Return the nums list
